Write a short game in which you have 5 one-way moves through a chamber.

Each time you have a chance to meet a crate or nothing on the way.

The crates have different colors.

The color of the crate indicates how rare the crate is.

green - 75%
orange - 20%
purple - 4%
gold (legendary) - 1%

Set that there is a 40% chance that you won't meet anything. 60% that there will be a crate.

Set gold as what can "fall out" of the crate:
green - 1000,
orange - 4000,
purple - 9000,
gold - 16000
